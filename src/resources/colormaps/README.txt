Colour Map naming convention:

                   linear_kryw_5-100_c67_n256
                     /      /    |    \    \
 Colour Map attribute(s)   /     |     \   Number of colour map entries
                          /      |      \
    String indicating nominal    |      Mean chroma of colour map
    hue sequence.                |
                             Range of lightness values

In addition, the name of the colour map may have cyclic shift information
appended to it, it may also have a flag indicating it is reversed. 
                                             
             cyclic_wrwbw_90-40_c42_n256_s25_r
                                         /    \
                                        /   Indicates that the map is reversed.
                                       / 
                 Percentage of colour map length
                 that the map has been rotated by.

* Attributes may be: linear, diverging, cyclic, rainbow, or isoluminant.  A
  colour map may have more than one attribute. For example, diverging-linear or
  cyclic-isoluminant.

* Lightness values can range from 0 to 100. For linear colour maps the two
  lightness values indicate the first and last lightness values in the
  map. For diverging colour maps the second value indicates the lightness value
  of the centre point of the colour map (unless it is a diverging-linear
  colour map). For cyclic and rainbow colour maps the two values indicate the
  minimum and maximum lightness values. Isoluminant colour maps have only
  one lightness value. 

* The string of characters indicating the nominal hue sequence uses the following code
     r - red      g - green      b - blue
     c - cyan     m - magenta    y - yellow
     o - orange   v - violet 
     k - black    w - white      j - grey

  ('j' rhymes with grey). Thus a 'heat' style colour map would be indicated by
  the string 'kryw'. If the colour map is predominantly one colour then the
  full name of that colour may be used. Note these codes are mainly used to
  indicate the hues of the colour map independent of the lightness/darkness and
  saturation of the colours.

* Mean chroma/saturation is an indication of vividness of the colour map. A
  value of 0 corresponds to a greyscale. A value of 50 or more will indicate a
  vivid colour map.
